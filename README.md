# MaterialAnimationsDemo

--> Animate activity layout content when transitioning from one activity to another.
--> Animate shared elements (Hero views) in transitions between activities.
--> Animate view changes within same activity.


# Transitions between Activities

Animate existing activity layout **content**

That code would produce transition between four scenes in the same activity. Each transition has a different animation defined. 

Transition Framework will take all visible views in current scene and calculate whatever necessary animations are needed to arrange those views according to next scene.


# Layout changes

Transition Framework can also be used to animate layout property changes in a view. You just need to make whatever changes you want and it will perform necessary animations for you
